## Highlights
**[How To Fine-Tune GPT-J](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax/blob/master/howto_finetune.md)**
- If you want to fine-tune a large language model, GPT-J is a good place to start (at least now, in July 2021). I wrote a guide on how to do so, part of the [official repo here](https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax).

**[This Bot Crime Did Not Occur](https://twitter.com/BotMugshots)**

- StyleGAN 2 ADA, trained on 10,000 mugshots from the Illinois Department of Corrections, only a fraction of the nearly 70,000 mugshots in their database.
- The US imprisons too many people; mugshots shouldn't be so widely available. More in the pinned tweet thread.

## Works In Progress
- a novel
- a game with N.H.
- more wyrd art
